This library provides combinators and typeclasses for working and manipulating
type-level predicates in Haskell, which are represented as matchable type-level
functions `k ~> Type` from the *singletons* library.  See *Data.Type.Predicate*
for a good starting point, and the documentation for `Predicate` on how to
define predicates.
